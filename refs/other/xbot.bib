abstract = {This paper introduces XBot2, a novel real-time middleware for robotic applications with a strong focus on modularity and reusability of components, and seamless support for multi-threaded, mixed real-time (RT) and non-RT architectures. Compared to previous works, XBot2 focuses on providing a dynamic, ready-to-use hardware abstraction layer that allows users to make run-time queries about the robot topology, and act consequently, by leveraging an easy-to-use API that is fully RT-compatible. We provide an extensive description about implementation challenges and design decisions, and finally validate our architecture with multiple use-cases. These range from the integration of three popular simulation tools (i.e. Gazebo, PyBullet, and MuJoCo), to real-world tests involving complex, hybrid robotic platforms such as IITâ€™s CENTAURO and MoCA robots.}
